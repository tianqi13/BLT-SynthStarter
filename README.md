# ES CW2 - BLT

The report shall contain:
14. An identification of all the tasks that are performed by the system with their method of implementation: thread or interrupt
15. A characterisation of each task with its theoretical minimum initiation interval (including assumptions used) and measured maximum execution time
16. A critical instant analysis of the rate monotonic scheduler, showing that all deadlines are met
under worst-case conditions
17. A quantification of total CPU utilisation
18. An identification of all the shared data structures and the methods used to guarantee safe access
and synchronisation
19. An analysis of inter-task blocking dependencies that shows any possibility of deadlock
